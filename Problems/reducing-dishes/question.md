# 1402. Reducing Dishes

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sorting

[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/)

## Description

A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient **that the chef can obtain after preparing some amount of dishes.

Dishes can be prepared in **any **order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == satisfaction.length`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Use dynamic programming to find the optimal solution by saving the previous best like-time coefficient and its corresponding element sum.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

If adding the current element to the previous best like-time coefficient and its corresponding element sum would increase the best like-time coefficient, then go ahead and add it. Otherwise, keep the previous best like-time coefficient.
