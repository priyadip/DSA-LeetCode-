**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topics:** Math, Enumeration

[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-divisible-digit-product-i/)

## Description

You are given two integers `n` and `t`. Return the **smallest** number greater than or equal to `n` such that the **product of its digits** is divisible by `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, t = 2

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 15, t = 3

**Output:** 16

**Explanation:**

The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= t <= 10`
